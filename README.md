# DS-worstcase-BigO-Practical
The objective of this practical is to understand basic concepts of Data Structures and Asymptotic Notations. Data Structures organize data efficiently for operations like insertion, deletion, searching and traversal. Asymptotic Notations analyze algorithm performance using Best, Worst and Average cases as input size increases gradually more!
